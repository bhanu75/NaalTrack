## 💡 Top Project: NaalTrack - Smart Water Supply Tracker

**Problem I Solved:** In Udaipur, government water comes every alternate day, but people (including me) forget the schedule, especially when traveling. Miss the timing = empty tanks = frustrated families.

**My Approach:**
- **User-First Thinking:** No login required - people don't have time for accounts when they just want to check water timings
- **Mobile-First Design:** Built for phones because nobody opens laptops to check water schedule
- **Smart Calculations:** Input last supply date once → app predicts next 7 days automatically
- **Real-World Testing:** Shared publicly on Vercel, got feedback requesting payment gateway for water bills

**Tech Stack & Why:**
- **React + Vite:** Chose over plain HTML for component reusability and cleaner code management
- **Tailwind CSS:** Rapid UI development with consistent design system
- **localStorage:** Preferred over database - keeps it simple and instant (no server dependency)
- **PWA-ready:** Mobile-optimized with offline capabilities

**Key Technical Challenge:** Date calculation logic was tricky - initially showed outdated schedules when user's last supply was 2-3 days old. Fixed by implementing dynamic date handling that always calculates from current date.

**Real Impact:** 
- Deployed and shared publicly - solving a genuine community problem
- Users requested additional features (payment gateway for water bills)
- 3-day build time from concept to production

## 🧠 How I Think as a Developer

**Problem-First Approach:** I don't build for the sake of building. NaalTrack came from my own frustration with forgetting water schedules while traveling.

**User Experience Over Features:** Could've added user accounts, but realized people want quick answers, not more passwords to remember. Sometimes simpler is smarter.

**My Go-To Stack:** React + Tailwind CSS + Vercel deployment. This combo lets me move fast from idea to live app without getting stuck in setup hell.

**What I Avoid:** Over-engineering. When localStorage solves the problem, I don't force a database just to look "full-stack."

## 📚 Learning in Public

**Currently Learning:** Advanced React patterns and state management
**Why:** Want to handle complex user flows better (like the payment gateway users requested)
**Building:** Enhanced version of NaalTrack with water, gas, and electricity tracking - practicing component composition

**Recent Win:** Mastered date handling in JavaScript after debugging NaalTrack's calculation issues. Now confident with complex date logic.

## 🎯 What I'm Looking For

**Role:** Frontend Developer position where I can own features end-to-end and work closely with users to solve real problems.

**Company:** Startups or teams that value user feedback and iterative development. Bonus if it's solving everyday problems for Indian users.

**Growth:** Want to work with experienced developers who can teach me advanced React patterns and help me think like a product person.
